# bold2py
 
bold2py is a small python project enabling you to use BOLDs API within python.

I'll likely add some more features and stuff  (e.g aving files) soon.
This project is a small part of my master's thesis and currently under development.
Depending on my thesis needs, this project will get more or fewer updates and features.
 
## API Documentation
This section will cover a short documentation of the different APIs provided by BOLD.
